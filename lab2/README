calloc should allocate (stringSize + 1) number of members instead of
solely stringSize because it is failing to account for the size of the
null termination character in the string being copied (line 343).

valgrind noted that a chunk of memory allocated by realloc (line 444) was never freed.

Files:
arraylist.c
Makefile

How to Run & Compile:
'make' or 'make all' will compile arraylist.c.
After compiling, './arraylist' will run the program.
'make clean' will remove any unnecessary object and binary files.

Description:
arraylist gets input from the user and stores it in a dynamic array.
The user will be prompted with three options: Insert, Print, and Quit.
If 'I' is entered, the user will input an integer to be stored in the array.
If 'P' is entered, the number of elements in the array will be printed, along with
each individual element.
If 'Q' is entered, the program terminates.

How to compile and run:
Run 'make', 'make all', or 'make parfait' to compile the program.
Run 'make clean' to remove unnecessary object and binary files.
To run the program, run './parfait -n K' where '-n' is an optional flag
and 'K' is a required natural number argument if given '-n'.  If no '-n'
flag is present, the program will run up to the first 100,000 numbers by default.

Description:
This program (./parfait) goes through numbers 2 through K,
determining whether each number is prime (P), composite (C), and perfect (E).
If composite (C), its prime factorization is listed.
If perfect (E), its proper divisors are also listed.
The program takes advantage of bit manipulation and the sieve of Eratosthenes
in order to perform these operations in a reasonable and efficient manner.

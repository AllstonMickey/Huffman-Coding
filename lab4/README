How to Compile & Run:
'./make', './make all', and './make increment' compile the program.
'./make clean' removes extraneous object and binary files created during compilation.
'./increment -n <nthread>' runs the program with nthread number of threads.  The -n argument is required.

Description:
This program increments a counter initialized at 0.  Each thread calls a function which increments
the counter through 1000 iterations.  The number of threads to spawn is specified by the -n argument.



A mutex is a structure with a value that signals to other concurrent threads if
it is currently active in a critical section or not.  This prevents a shared variable
being modified by concurrent threads until the ongoing thread has completed its execution.

A race condition is when a shared variable is being modified by multiple threads at once in a
critical section, causing the threads to "race" each other to modify the variable before the others.
If this happens, the resulting behavior is not deterministic and some data may be lost due.

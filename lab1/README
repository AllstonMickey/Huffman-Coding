Files:
cat.c
hello.c
Makefile

How to compile and run:
Run 'make' or 'make all' to compile cat and hello.  Alternatively, compile separately
with 'make cat' or 'make hello'.  Use 'make clean' to remove object and binary files.
Run './cat <arg1> <arg2> ... <argn>' to use the program, each <argk> argument is optional.
Each argument should be a file to read from.
Run './hello' to write 'Hello, world!' to terminal.

Description:
'./cat' mimics the behavior of UNIX 'cat'.  Given extra <argn> files as arguments, ./cat will read them
from standard input and write them to standard output, concatenating each file with each other.
Given no arguments, ./cat will continuously be waiting for input from the user.  When given input,
./cat will write the input back to the user.  The user must quit then program when done (CTRL-D).
'hello.c' is a simple 'Hello, world!' program which can be used as an example.

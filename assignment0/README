Description:
This program plays the game "Left, Right, and Center".
An arbitrary seed is chosen, and it is able to be played with 2-10 players inclusive.
By rolling a die (the amount of times rolled relates to the amount of money a player has),
the player can give $1 to the left/previous player, to the right/next player, or in the pot (center).
The player can also roll a pass which ignores the roll.  The game ends when only one player has money.
